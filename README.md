# Zeal

## What is Zeal?
Imagine you are joining an event that requires you to create a team, and you feel- “Oh GOD! I really hope I don’t get random bad teammates. I really want to perform well!”, or you have an amazing idea and you are so excited and full of zeal to work on it, but for that, you either need to find team members who already know the skills to execute the idea or you have to learn the skills. Either way, you would be wasting a lot of time and resources researching the technicalities. Finally, if you work for a startup, one of the major fear is to get the right and best people who can work towards the growth and success of your breakthrough ideas. Relatable?
 
Don’t worry anymore! We have addressed all these issues with Zeal…
We help hackathons and event participants, startups, and individuals with ideas to find worthy team members who can together execute their ideas to reality, instead of wasting precious time researching the technicalities and losing the overall focus. Hence, filling the gap between people with ideas and people who can execute.
